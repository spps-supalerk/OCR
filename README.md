# OCR
I created this repo for keeping scripts I played or experimented.</br>
Most of code are kept in ".ipynb" to show how each line of code works.</br>

Optical Character Recognition(OCR) is technic to get text from image. In this script I tried to campare performance of each algorithm when used with .pdf from ThaiME website. </br>
</br>
For result of experiments </br>
Google Vision is the best for extracting text from .pdf when measures are accuracy and processing time. However, It comes with high cost per request. </br>
Pytesseract is great but I found some problems (accuracy) with Thai language. </br>
EasyOCR is really great but takes so much time to process.</br>
list of topics in this repo are list below</br>

<li>OCR_ggVision_Pytesseract_Easyocr.ipynb : to compare performance between GoogleVision, EasyOCR, Pytesseract </li>
